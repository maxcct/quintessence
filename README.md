# Elemental

To run the game, download the files, navigate to the folder you've downloaded
them to using command line / terminal, then enter `python quintessence.py`.
You'll need to have Python installed.

To play, take turns using the mouse (and for a couple of things, discussed
below, the arrow keys) with another player.

The objective is to get one of each type of your element pieces (at least one
air, fire, water and earth piece) all the way over to your opponent's side of
the board. Alternatively, you can win by eliminating all of any one of your
opponent's element types (which would make it impossible for them to win if
the game were to continue).

For the moveset and attack roles of each element, please see the included
diagram. The paths shown in pink rather than purple indicate alternative
move patterns that can be switched to using the corresponding arrow keys
for air pieces, or the `up` key (upwards diagonal) or `down` key (downwards
diagonal) for water pieces. Switching direction in this way uses up a turn:
i.e., you cannot change direction and move in the same turn.

Please note that the illustrated directions of movement for air and water
pieces (rightwards) are flipped for player two, and the direction shown for
the fire piece (leftwards) is flipped for player one.
